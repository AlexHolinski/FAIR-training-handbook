## Importance of attribution of credit

Attributing credit is as important for training material as it is for scientific literature. While in the scientific literature authors and co-authors are listed, the following roles play an important part in the context of  training material.

* Author
* Teacher / trainer
* Contributor

We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. 

Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition.

In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors.
