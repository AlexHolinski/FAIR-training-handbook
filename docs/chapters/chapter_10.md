## Description

This chapter will explain why it is important to add attributions to your training material. We will define the roles of author, trainers and contributor and ways of how to attribute credit to them in the contact of training material. It will also discuss of how you can encourage others to contribute to your material. 

## Learning Outcomes

1. Recognise the importance of attribution
2. Explain why it is important to encourage continous contributions and acknowledgements
3. Define the difference between author, trainer and contributor 
4. Define criteria for acknowledgements
5. Describe roles for credit attribution as an additional way of credit attribution
6. Describe ways to engage communities (trainers and trainees) to get contributions and feedback
7. Use persistent identifiers for people in the context of attribution
8. Describe how to capture contributors and authors depending on the repository / platform
9. Provide credit for other training material


## Importance of attribution of credit

Attributing credit is as important for training material as it is for scientific literature. While in the scientific literature authors and co-authors are listed, the following roles play an important part in the context of  training material.

* Author
* Teacher / trainer
* Contributor

We will define these roles in more detail in the next section and also clarify how credit is attributed for each of them. 

Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition.

In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions. In the end, attributing contact creates a community of trainers and contributors.

!!! example "Exercise"
    Potential learning experience: Search for training material online and analyse how credit is attributed and to whom. (in groups, 10 mins, 5 min search, 5 min wrap-up)

## Different roles 

Each **author** is expected to:

- Have made substantial contributions to at least one of the following:
    a. conception or design
    b. creation of exercises
    c. creation of lectures
    d. creation of the learner’s environment
    e. drafting/revision
- Have approved the course version
- Be personally accountable for their contributions

Each **teacher / trainer** is expected to have had interactions with learners during the respective course version as part of a didactic process.

Each **contributor** has contributed to the course material including, but not limited to:

- Improvement of exercises and lectures
- Testing and evaluation of exercises/lectures/learner’s environment

Everyone who does not meet authorship, contributor or trainer criteria but deserve so should be acknowledged. For example, persons or organisations should be attributed if their course material was used as base or inspiration for the current course material version. Ideally this should be in the form of a citation.

!!! note 
    Minimum information for citations: 
    Author, year, material title, version, DOI

To eliminate name confusion and ensure appropriate attribution to the authors and teachers, it is highly recommended to adapt ORCID iDs.

### Where to list them?

**Authors**

- On the course website main page, including ORCiD.
- In the README.md in the github repository.
- In the .zenodo.json file
- Any other appropriate metadata file

**Teachers**

On the course website main page, including ORCiD.

**Contributors**

- In the case of a repository: automatic contributor of the repository.
- Otherwise, where appropriate (see below at *Acknowledgment/citation*)

**Acknowledgement / Citation**

Where appropriate:
- At the course website main page for general acknowledgement (e.g. ‘this course was inspired by …’)
- At the appropriate presentation slide
- At the appropriate course page

## Importance to encourage contribution

It is important to encourage contribution to training material as this will allow for the training content to develop over time, and thus to be kept updated. In addition potential mistakes can be identified and corrected. And the quality of the material will increase with more contributions. Acknowledging contributions serves as a motivation for people to contribute and will drive the formation of a community of interest.
 
## Credit matrix

It is more and more common in scientific literature to use a matrix for clarifying contributions to a publication. Such a matrix provides a standardised list of contributor roles and allows to assign authors to these roles. One example of such a matrix is the CRediT matrix. The CRediT matrix was reworked for the purpose of training material and is provided below. It should become best practice to use such a matrix also for training materials.

The CRediT matrix can be helpful in evaluating whether a person is an author or contributor. Usually an author has made a significant contribution to one or more roles in the CRediT matrix. Related to this, it can be used to describe the actual responsibilities of the different authors. 

| CRediT role                	| Relevance training 	| Interpretation in training context                                            	|
