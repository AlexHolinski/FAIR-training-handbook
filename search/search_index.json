Attributing credit to these roles makes them (most often scientists) more visible, serves as proof of their effort beyond pure research and can bring these scientists additional recognition. In addition, it clarifies the responsibilities of those who contributed to certain content of the training material and the training session and thus allows trainers who will re-use the training material to contact these people with potential follow-up questions.
